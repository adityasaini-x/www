#+TITLE: Now Page -- Balagopal Komarath

I am spending most of my time on research and coursework at IIT
Gandhinagar. I am teaching [[file:../teaching/2024/aug/dm.org][ES214: Discrete Mathematics]] in academic
year 2024-25, semester I (Jul-Nov). I am advising two doctoral
scholars, Rohit Narayanan and Priyanshi Agrawal; and one Master's
student, Alay Patel.

I am (slowly) progressing towards completing two textbooks -- one on
fundamental datastructures and algorithms and another on reading,
understanding, and writing mathematical proofs. When I am done
writing, these books will be availble for free online.
