I am spending most of my time on research and teaching courses at IIT
Gandhinagar.

I am advising two doctoral scholars, Rohit Narayanan and Priyanshi
Agrawal; and one Master's student, Alay Patel.

I am teaching [[file:../teaching/2025/jan/compilers.org][Compilers]] and [[file:../teaching/2025/jan/dcc.org][Data-Centric Computing]] in academic year
2024-25, semester II (Jan-Apr) and guiding the following semester-long
projects:
- A stacking Wayland WM from tinywl.

Long-term, I am trying to complete two textbooks -- one on fundamental
datastructures and algorithms and another on reading, understanding,
and writing mathematical proofs. When I am done writing, these books
will be availble for free online.
