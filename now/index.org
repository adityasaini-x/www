#+TITLE: Now -- Balagopal Komarath

I am spending most of my time on research and teaching courses at IIT
Gandhinagar.

I am advising two doctoral scholars, Rohit Narayanan and Priyanshi
Agrawal; and one Master's student, Alay Patel.

I am teaching [[file:../teaching/2024/aug/dm.org][ES214: Discrete Mathematics]] in academic year 2024-25,
semester I (Jul-Nov) and guiding the following semester-long projects:
- Hazard-free formulas for MUX.
- Development of a light-weight competitive programming online judge.

Long-term, I am trying to complete two textbooks -- one on fundamental
datastructures and algorithms and another on reading, understanding,
and writing mathematical proofs. When I am done writing, these books
will be availble for free online.
