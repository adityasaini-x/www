#+TITLE: Computational Complexity Theory

First time computational complexity theory was offered as a regular
course at IIT Gandhinagar since the CS discipline was formed. The
course had code CS 617. I co-taught this course with Bireswar Das. See
the [[https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/5101493][Canvas page for computational complexity theory in 2022 (requires
invitation)]].
