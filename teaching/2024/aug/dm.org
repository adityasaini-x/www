#+TITLE: Discrete Mathematics

This course is an introduction to proofs and structures common in
computer science. The goal is to learn how to read and write proofs
and then use that to argue about basic structures found in computer
science. The following topics are covered in this course.

1. Assertions.
2. Rules: hypotheses and conclusion.
3. Proofs or derivations of assertions.
4. Propositions
5. Introduction and elimination.
6. Hypothetical derivations: assumptions and discharge.
7. Implication and negation.
8. Predicates and quantification.
9. Inductive definitions and the principle of induction.
