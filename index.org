Hello! I am Balagopal Komarath. In Malayalam, my name is written as
ബാലഗോപാൽ കോമരത്ത്.

I am an assistant professor in the [[https://cs.iitgn.ac.in/][discipline of computer science and
engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, India]]. My office address is AB13/405B.

Before joining [[https://iitgn.ac.in/][IIT Gandhinagar]], I was a postdoctoral researcher in
[[https://cc.cs.uni-saarland.de/][Markus Bläser's computational complexity group at Saarland
University]]. I did my PhD from [[https://theory.cse.iitm.ac.in/][Jayalal Sarma's computational complexity
group at IIT Madras, India]].

* Recent News

I am teaching [[file:teaching/2024/aug/dm.org][ES214: Discrete Mathematics]] in academic year 2024-25,
semester I (Jul-Nov).

* Research

I am interested in hazard-free circuit complexity, algebraic circuit
complexity, and graph homomorphism related algorithms.

The following list contains peer-reviewed publications that I have
co-authored in reverse chronological order.
