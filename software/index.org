#+TITLE: Software -- Balagopal Komarath
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

I use libre software whenever possible. Exceptions include work
related software (cloud-based offie suites for collaboration with
collegues) and firmware to make my devices work.

Here is a list of software that I use:
- Debian as the OS. I used to use Arch, btw.
- Firefox as my web browser. With the right configuration, FF seems to
  be the browser that sucks the least.
- Emacs as my main editor and [[https://github.com/balu/ted][ted]] for small editing tasks on the
  terminal.
- rsync and rsync.net for backup.
- OpenBSD on my server.
- [[https://github.com/balu/mypass][mypass]] for password management. I don't think we should store
  passwords on the cloud or on the browser for extended periods of
  time.
