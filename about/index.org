#+TITLE: About -- Balagopal Komarath

I am a researcher who works in computational complexity theory,
algorithms, and CS education.

The problems I am interested in solving are:
- What are the limits for building digital circuits that work without
  glitches?
- How do people learn programming, develop programs, and debug them?
  How can we use this knowledge to improve programming education?

I am a supporter of libre software, and an advocate for technological
independence and privacy (digital and otherwise).

If you think you know me from somewhere, the following timeline may
help you figure it out:
- Schooling from NSS, Thrissur (Till 2001)
- Higher-secondary schooling from GVHSS, Ayyanthole, Thrissur (2001--2003)
- Bachelor's in computer science from GEC, Thrissur (2003--2007)
- Software engineer at TATA ELXSI, Thiruvananthapuram (2007--2009)
- Master's in computer science from IIT Madras (2009--2011)
- PhD scholar at IIT Madras (2011--2016)
- Postdoctoral researcher at Saarland University (2016--2020)
- Assistant Professor at IIT Gandhinagar (2020 onwards)
